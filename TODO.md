The chapters need to be marked up and put into web pages

The examples need to be inserted at appropriate places in the text, using Coliru.

Homework should maybe be at the end of each chapter as well as in the middle. (Not enough to overwhelm, but enough to give them practice as they learn)

Homework and examples need to be looked at with a critical eye to make sure it covers all the topics in all the various ways they can be used. (For example, if we're talking vectors, then reading from vectors, writing to vectors, changing vectors, adding up stuff in a vector, etc.)

Homework and examples should be proofread and edited for clarity. (Big one)

Make a PDF textbook; if Coliru won't embed in it, then link to a web page with the examples and homework loaded.
