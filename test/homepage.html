        <h1>Pyro C++ | A Novice Programmer's Baptism of Fire</h1>
        <h3>A Brief Prologue</h3>
        <p>
            Computers are like <em>fire.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            They light up the world with information, sifting through a vast digital sea to deliver the right bits to the right ports.
        </p>
        <p>
            They work with fiery speed, capable of doing billions of operations per second.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like fire, they are powerful. They can beat the world's best chess players. They can see in pitch black via infrared. They can communicate without uttering a word. They can cripple entire countries if they aren't taken seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
            And like fire, they also have a dependency... the oxygen that fuels flames is to the programmer that facilitates a computer's operation. If the programmer is incompetent then the computer's flame will die. To unlock the full power of these electronic behemoths requires discipline, devotion, and a deadset passion.

            In this free online book, you will learn about the C++ programming language, one of the most popular programming languages. In fact, the operating system of the computer you're reading this on probably uses C++!
        </p> 
        <p>
            When used properly, C++ allows for faster computation than most other languages, and it gives you access into hardware components that are buried deep under layers and layers of abstractions. Indeed, C++ is one of the most powerful languages in the modern day, and plenty of jobs still ask for proficiency in it!
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim of this book is to provide that proficiency, and hopefully spark a new interest in the incredible powers of computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not be overwhelmed by the complexity of the subject at hand, for Pyro C++ will be your shining torch of hope in the big, strange world of programming. So go forth and learn!
