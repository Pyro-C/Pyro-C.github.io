<h3 id="41basicvectoroperations">4.1 - Basic Vector Operations</h3>
<p>The <em>vector</em> is one of the simplest data structures in C++, but its usefulness knows no bounds. You
can think about vectors as a list of elements of some datatype. Let's dive right in with an
example!</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
// We have to include `vector` from the STL to use it.
#include &lt;vector&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Let's declare a vector of integers.
    // First, we type `vector`.
    // Then, in between angled brackets, we declare the datatype this vector will hold.
    // Then add a space, and type the name of the vector.
    // Don't forget the semicolon!
    vector&lt;int&gt; my_vector;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The program above declares a vector, then exits out of the program, doing nothing else.</p>
<hr />
<p>NOTE: For brevity's sake, we won't be typing this boilerplate code in future examples:</p>
<pre><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt;
#include&lt;vector&gt;
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // A bunch of code.
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Assume that all code is written in <code>main</code> unless stated otherwise.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, let's get back to vectors.</p>
<pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; my_vector;
</code></pre>
<p>We just declared this vector, but we added nothing to it. Therefore, its size must be zero.
To get the size of a vector, use the <code>.size()</code> method.</p>
<pre><code>int size_of_my_vector = my_vector.size()
cout &lt;&lt; size_of_my_vector &lt;&lt; endl;
// The above code will print out `0` to the screen.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that vectors are like lists. Let's try adding an item to our "list"!
We declared <code>my_vector</code> to hold integers, so it can only hold integers.
Let's try adding an integer to the vector. We have to use <code>.push_back(something)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>my_vector.push_back(22);
my_vector.push_back(8);
my_vector.push_back(42);
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could also use the following syntax with braces <code>{}</code>:</p>
<pre><code>my_vector = {22, 8, 42};
</code></pre>
<p>Every item in a vector is given an <em>index</em>. You can think of indices (plural for "index") as kinda
like "page numbers". Indices keep track of the order of elements in a vector. In order to use them,
we have to use square brackets like so: <code>[index]</code>.</p>
<pre><code>// Indices start at 0, and increase by 1 for every element added afterwards.
int first_element = my_vector[0];
cout &lt;&lt; first_element &lt;&lt; endl;
// The above code will print out `22` to the screen, since that was the first thing added.
cout &lt;&lt; my_vector[1] &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; my_vector[2] &lt;&lt; endl;
// The above code will print out `8` and then `42`.
</code></pre>
<p>You can use indices to remove elements from a vector. The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>vec.erase(vec.begin() + index);
</code></pre>
<p>So with our vector, <code>my_vector</code>, if we wanted to remove the second element (which is at index 1),
we should do the following:</p>
<pre><code>my_vector.erase(my_vector.begin() + 1)
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>NOTE: This syntax may seem strange at first, but don't worry. The short story is that it relies on
objects called <em>pointers</em>, which we will learn about later in chapter 5, where we talk about
functions and "call by reference" parameters. For now, we will move on.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now let's remove the other elements in our vector! We already took away the second element, <code>8</code>,
which means that the new element in that index is <code>42</code>. Let's remove that and the first element,
<code>22</code>.</p>
<pre><code>my_vector.erase(my_vector.begin() + 1)
my_vector.erase(my_vector.begin() + 0)  // The `+ 0` is optional.
cout &lt;&lt; my_vector.size() &lt;&lt; endl;  // This will print `0` since everything's gone now.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="42vectorswotherdatatypes">4.2 - Vectors w/ Other Datatypes</h3>
<p>Everything we talked about in <code>4.1</code> is relevant to other datatypes as well! Nothing fundamentally
changes when operating with other datatypes. Here, we present some code snippets of vectors holding
commonly-used datatypes. We do some of the same operations we talked about in <code>4.1</code>.</p>
<p>With <em>strings</em>:</p>
<pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt; vec;
vec.push_back("hello world");
// Prints out `hello world`.
cout &lt;&lt; vec[0] &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>
<p>With <em>floats</em>:</p>
<pre><code>vector&lt;float&gt; vec;
vec.push_back(3.14);
// Prints out `Pi is approximately 3.14`.
cout &lt;&lt; "Pi is approximately: " &lt;&lt; vec[0] &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>
<p>With <em>booleans</em>:</p>
<pre><code>vector&lt;bool&gt; vec;
vec.push_back(true);
vec.push_back(false);
// Prints out `2`.
cout &lt;&lt; vec.size() &lt;&lt; endl;
vec.erase(vec.begin() + 1);
vec.erase(vec.begin());
// Prints out `0`
cout &lt;&lt; vec.size() &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>
<p>You can even make vectors out of vectors!</p>
<pre><code>vector&lt;vector&lt;string&gt;&gt; groceries;
vector&lt;string&gt; produce;
vector&lt;string&gt; dairy;
groceries.push_back(produce);
groceries.push_back(dairy);
// Adding `apples` to the first vector in `groceries`, which is `produce`.
groceries[0].push_back("apples");
// Prints out the first element of the first vector: `apples`
cout &lt;&lt; groceries[0][0] &lt;&lt; endl;
// Prints out `2` since there are two vectors inside of `groceries`.
cout &lt;&lt; groceries.size() &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="43rangebasedforloops">4.3 - Range Based <code>for</code> Loops</h3>
<p>You can use indices to loop through vectors. Let's say you have a vector:</p>
<pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt; fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "peach", "strawberry"};
</code></pre>
<p>The following code will print every element in <code>fruits</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; fruits.size(); i++) {
    cout &lt;&lt; fruits[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a typical <code>for</code> loop like the one we learned about in the last chapter, but there's also
another way you can loop through the elements of a vectorâ€”a special kind of <code>for</code> loop called a
"range-based <code>for</code> loop". Let's check out the syntax:</p>
<pre><code>// Here `fruit` is just a placeholder variable that will be filled in with each element.
// You could replace `fruit` with any name!
// `fruits` is the name of the vector from which we are getting each element.
for (string fruit : fruits) {
    cout &lt;&lt; fruit &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>
<p>When looping through elements of a vector, we recommend using this type of <code>for</code> loop. This loop is
much simpler than the previous one, and it avoids having to keep track of indices. It's also much
more readable!</p>
<p>Let's see one more example:</p>
<pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; vec;
vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
cout &lt;&lt; "Let's count to five!" &lt;&lt; endl;
for (int number : vec) {
    cout &lt;&lt; number &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>
