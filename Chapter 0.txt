Learning to program is awesome! The whole world is becoming more digital, and in almost any field, having some knowledge of programming will help you out. While some programming jobs might require doctorates in computer science to carry out, a large number of junior positions are available to people with only a year of programming under their belt. This textbook covers the first half year of a computer science education.

While getting that graduate degree is a long road, the good news is that when programming, there's really only six things that you can actually do in a programming langauge. I think of them like tools used to build a house. While building a house is a complex endeavor that takes a lot of time, learning how to use a hammer or saw is actually not that complicated, and can be picked up easily.

The only six things you can do in computer science are as follows:
1) Input and output with the user
2) Creating variables, like in algebra
3) Doing math
4) Choosing between doing one thing or another
5) Doing something multiple times
6) Using someone else's program

And that's it! Everything else in computer science is just more complicated combinations of the above.

We have a chapter on each of these topics. By the time you finish this textbook, you will have mastered the basic tools of computer science. After that, it gets even more fun - you get to figure out the best ways of putting them together.

This textbook will teach you how to program using a programming language called C++. C++ is a great programming language to start with. Learning it will prepare you very nicely for more advanced topics in computer science (like assembly programming and computer architecture) as well as making you rather employable worldwide, as there is always a demand for good C++ programmers.
